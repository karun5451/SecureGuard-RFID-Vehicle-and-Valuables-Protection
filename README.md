# SecureGuard RFID Protection

SecureGuard RFID Protection is a versatile and customizable security system designed to protect vehicles and valuables using RFID technology, Arduino, MPU6050, and MFRC522. This repository provides the complete source code and instructions to build a robust security system that can be tailored for various modes of operation, such as safeguarding vehicles or protecting valuable items.

## Features

- RFID-based locking and unlocking mechanism
- Advanced sensor-based event detection (acceleration, vibration, gyro rotation, temperature)
- Configurable mode of operation (vehicle or valuable items)
- Real-time event logging with timestamp
- Web-based control panel for easy configuration and monitoring
- Support for BLE-based locking/unlocking in the Pro version

## Components

- Nodemcu
- MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyro Sensor
- MFRC522 RFID Reader
- WiFi Module (ESP8266)
- Buzzer (for alarms)
- Light Sensor (optional, for ambient light detection)

## Getting Started

Follow the detailed [Setup Guide](/setup-guide.md) to set up and configure the SecureGuard RFID Protection system. The guide provides step-by-step instructions, circuit diagrams, and tips for customizing the system according to your needs.

## Usage

Once the system is set up, you can easily control and monitor your SecureGuard device using the web-based control panel. Access the control panel by connecting to the device's WiFi network and visiting the provided IP address.

## Pro Version

Upgrade to the Pro version for enhanced security and convenience. The Pro version introduces BLE-based locking/unlocking, allowing you to use a mobile app or a physical BLE tag as a key.
